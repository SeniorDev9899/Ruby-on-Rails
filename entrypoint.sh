# Shame on Docker: https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/7198
# This is ridiculous. It's been 7+ years and we still have no convenient way of
# mapping users between the containers and the host.
# This is not convenient: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/userns-remap/
# And having to deal with filesystem permissions on a development machine is
# beyond annoying and breaks exactly the kind of isolation one tries to achieve
# I wrote a hack like this in 2014. I shouldn't have to be writing the same
# hack in 2021.

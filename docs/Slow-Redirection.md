Scenario: Improve url redirection performance when under heavy load

Description: We didn't realize it during our pre-launch testing, but when our Social Networking Services (SNS) team posted an article on linkedin, we got more traffic than ever before and found out that redirection is slow for the most visited urls.

We've prepared a benchmark to test this out. First reset and seed the test database with urls and slugs:

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ time RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:reset benchmark=true
Dropped database 'talent_test_dev_test'
Created database 'talent_test_dev_test'
trying to insert 1000000 urls in the database

```

Then prepare the siege urls:

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ RAILS_ENV=benchmark bundle exec rails benchmark:slow_redirection:prepare
RAILS_ENV=benchmark environment is not defined in config/webpacker.yml, falling back to production environment
generating siege urls
done generating urls in /tmp/slow_redirection.txt
```

You can now run the benchmark itself:

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ RAILS_ENV=benchmark bundle exec rails benchmark:slow_redirection:run
RAILS_ENV=benchmark environment is not defined in config/webpacker.yml, falling back to production environment
running the benchmarking server
done, server pid is 38264
running benchmark for 5 minutes:
** SIEGE 4.0.4
** Preparing 100 concurrent users for battle.
The server is now under siege...

We'd like to improve the transaction rate by at least 20% of what it currently is. We know that your local development machine might be faster or slower than our test machines, so we're only looking for relative improvements.

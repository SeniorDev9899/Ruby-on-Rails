## How to run Vagrant

Virtualbox is a prerequisite for vagrant; you can get it from the [Virtualbox download page](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

You will then need to download and install vagrant for your operating system, then after cloning the repository you can start vagrant via `vagrant up` and it will automatically create and provision the development virtual machine for you.

It takes a couple of minutes for the initial provisioning, but subsequent invocations take only a few seconds (the time it takes for the virtual machine to boot up).

Here is an example log:

```

## How to access the Vagrant Virtual Machine for development

After starting the development vm via `vagrant up` it will automatically do the following:

* mount the current folder to the vm's `/home/vagrant/app` folder
* install ruby and nodejs
* install gems and node packages
* create the development and test db
* generate seed urls and statistics

That means that any changes you make to files will automatically be reflected in the development machine, and since rails is running in development mode it will automatically detect file changes and adapt accordingly.

You can ssh into the virtual machine using `vagrant ssh`.
You can start the application by running `foreman start -d ~/app` inside the virtual machine.

## How to view the logs (development, benchmark, etc)

Rails logs will be stored in `log/development.log`

Example output:

[Webpacker] Though the "loose" option was set to "false" in your @babel/preset-env config, it will not be used for @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods since the "loose" mode option was set to "true" for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties.
The "loose" option must be the same for @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties, @babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods and @babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object (when they are enabled): you can silence this warning by explicitly adding
        ["@babel/plugin-proposal-private-methods", { "loose": true }]
to the "plugins" section of your Babel config.

## How to run a rails console

Start by ssh-ing into the VM with `vagrant ssh` then run `cd app; bin/rails console`

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ bin/rails c
Running via Spring preloader in process 35518
Loading development environment (Rails 6.1.3.2)
irb: warn: can't alias context from irb_context.
3.0.0 :001 >
```

## How to interact with the API

We are using oauth as our authentication mechanism. For development, we are using the oauth developer strategy, which is found at `/auth/developer`.

Start by visiting the `/auth/developer` url. After filling in the name and email fields, you will be redirected to the previous url with a query parameter called `session_id` like so:

```
http://localhost:3000/?session_id=2592ca4d984b57f0094bfb99b9b5ec0c
```

Most of the apis are available without having to be authenticated; however if you want to generate an authenticated request, attach the query parameter `session_id` to the api url like so:

```
http://localhost:3000/api/urls/new?session_id=2592ca4d984b57f0094bfb99b9b5ec0c
```

In the rails app, you will now have the `current_user` helper method returning the current logged in user.

You can also access details of the current user by sending an authenticated request to `/api/users/whoami`

This whole workflow is also captured in the system spec `spec/system/login_spec.rb`:

``` ruby
it "logs in and uses the returned token to retrieve session info" do
  visit "/auth/developer"

  fill_in "Name", with: "rspec"
  fill_in "Email", with: "rspec@example.com"
  click_button "Sign In"

  expect(current_url).to include("session_id")

  session_id = URI(current_url).query.split("=")[1]
  visit "/api/users/whoami?session_id=#{session_id}"

  expect(page).to have_text("rspec@example.com")
end
```

## How to run the specs

We use rspec as our test harness. These are located in the `/spec` folder.

You can run the test if you `vagrant ssh` to the development machine, change into the `app` folder, and run `bundle exec rspec`:

``` bash
$ vagrant ssh
Last login: Wed Oct 21 16:29:00 2015 from 10.0.2.2
```
``` bash
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~$ cd app/
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ bundle exec rspec

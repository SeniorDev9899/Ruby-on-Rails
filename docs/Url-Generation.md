Scenario: Improve url generation performance when under heavy load

Description: We're in talks with a well-known Social Networking Service, and they would like to sue our link generation api platform as a white-labeled solution (think of twitter's t.co shortening service).

We've been fine with the current load, but we found that performance degrades significantly when dealing with the amount of traffic we're expecting once the SNS starts sending us traffic.

To properly quantify this, we've made a benchmark to measure the amount of time url generation requests would take.

If you haven't prepared the db with the urls, you should do so now (it only takes about 5 minutes):

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ time RAILS_ENV=test bundle exec rails db:reset benchmark=true
Dropped database 'talent_test_dev_test'

```

Then, prepare the urls for siege:

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ RAILS_ENV=benchmark bundle exec rails benchmark:url_generation:prepare
RAILS_ENV=benchmark environment is not defined in config/webpacker.yml, falling back to production environment
generating siege urls
done generating urls in /tmp/url_generation.txt
```

From this point on, you will just need to run the benchmark without having to seed the db nor prepare the siege urls:

```
vagrant@ubuntu2004:~/app$ RAILS_ENV=benchmark bundle exec rails benchmark:url_generation:run
RAILS_ENV=benchmark environment is not defined in config/webpacker.yml, falling back to production environment
